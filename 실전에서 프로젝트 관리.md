# Product Management in Practice
A Real-World Guide to the Key Connective Role of the 21st Century

## Introduction

### Why I Wrote This Book: My First Day as a Product Manager

I never felt more prepared for anything than I did for my first day as a product manager. Ever the eager student, I had made a point of reading up on the basic tenets of user experience, sharpening my programming skills, and learning about product development processes like Scrum and XP. I could recite the Agile Manifesto by heart, and knew about the industry-standard bounce rates for comparable web properties. After settling in at my new workstation, I approached my boss—who was not a product manager himself but had worked with enough of them to know the type—with the overconfident swagger of a young person who had read a lot of books very quickly.

“I’m so excited to really dig into this work,” I told him. “Where’s the latest version of the product roadmap? What are our quarterly goals and KPIs? And who should I be talking to if I want to better understand the needs of our users?”

He gave me a weary look and took a deep breath. “You’re smart,” he said, “Figure it out.”

Aside from a very generous assessment of my intelligence at the time, my boss gave me the greatest gift a new product manager can receive: a grim but resolute understanding that guidance would be very, very hard to come by. For all the books that I had read and all the methodologies that I had studied, the only thing I was left with when I sat back down at my desk was, “What the hell am I supposed to do every day?” If there was no roadmap, how was I supposed to manage the roadmap? If there was no product development process, how was I supposed to oversee the product development process?

Early on in my career, I chalked much of this up to the fast pace and loose job definitions that come with working at a startup. But as I began to do more consulting and training work at organizations of different sizes and types, similar patterns began to present themselves. Even in highly process-driven enterprise organizations, much of the actual work of product management seemed to be taking place on the margins and in the shadows. Product ideas were being hashed out over coffee breaks, not planning meetings. Highly prescriptive scaled Agile frameworks were being bypassed by savvy politicking. Subterfuge, backchannels, and influence reigned supreme. And those same questions I had asked myself on my first day as a product manager were still being asked by product managers at organizations large and small, at cutting-edge technology startups and slow-moving enterprises, by new and experienced product managers alike.

Product management in practice is very different from product management in theory. In theory, product management is about building products that people love. In practice, product management often means fighting for incremental improvements on products that are facing much more fundamental challenges. In theory, product management is about triangulating business goals with user needs. In practice, product management often means pushing relentlessly to get any kind of clarity about what business “goals” really are. In theory, product management is a masterfully played game of chess. In practice, product management often feels like a hundred simultaneous games of checkers.

To that end, this book is not a step-by-step guide to building great products, nor is it a list of frameworks and technical concepts guaranteed to bring you Product Management Success™. This book is intended to help you through the challenges that no tool, framework, or “best practice” can prepare you for. This book is about the day-to-day practice of product management with all its ambiguity, contradictions, and grudging compromises. Simply put, this is the book that I wish I had on my first day as a product manager, and many, many days thereafter.
